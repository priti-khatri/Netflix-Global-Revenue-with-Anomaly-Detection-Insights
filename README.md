Synthetic but realistic multi-year revenue data powers Plotly visualizations, enabling exploration of growth patterns and revenue health.

Tabs separate views for Revenue & Anomalies and Subscribers & Marketing, making the dashboard easy to navigate.

The storytelling module summarizes key patterns and provides actionable recommendations, simulating a real Finance & Strategy workflow.

Built using Python, Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
